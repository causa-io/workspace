# ðŸ”– Changelog

## Unreleased

Fixes:

- Export `ProcessorInstruction`.

## v0.2.0 (2023-05-05)

Breaking changes:

- Processors are no longer loaded from the configuration by default. Instead, they should be passed to `WorkspaceContext.init()` or `WorkspaceContext.clone()`.
- Module dependencies in the configuration are now defined as a dictionary, and relative paths are resolved from the workspace root. For regular (non-path like) modules, the `semver` is checked.

## v0.1.1 (2023-05-04)

Fixes:

- Fix incorrect package exports.

## v0.1.0 (2023-05-04)

Features:

- The first version of the @causa/workspace package, implementing the `WorkspaceContext`.
